---

## 🔧 Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Dynamic Server Usage Errors - RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem**: API routes were causing build failures due to dynamic server usage
```
Error: Route /api/dashboard/stats couldn't be rendered statically because it used `request.url`
```

**Solution**: 
- Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all API routes
- Replaced `new URL(request.url)` with `request.nextUrl.searchParams`
- Fixed in files:
  - `/app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/mentors/route.ts`
  - `/app/api/requests/route.ts`

### 2. **Environment Configuration - RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem**: Environment variables were corrupted with byte encoding
**Solution**: Completely rewrote `.env` file with proper formatting

### 3. **Database Setup - COMPLETED ✅**

**Problem**: No database was configured
**Solution**: 
- Set up SQLite database with Prisma ORM
- Generated Prisma client
- Applied database migrations
- Populated with comprehensive seed data
- Created 5 demo users across different roles
- Added sample internship requests

### 4. **Missing Dependencies - RESOLVED ✅**

**Problem**: Node modules not installed
**Solution**: 
- Installed all required dependencies
- Fixed peer dependency conflicts
- Updated security vulnerabilities
